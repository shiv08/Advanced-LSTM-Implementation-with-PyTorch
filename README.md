## 🔬 Technical Implementation Details

### LSTM Cell Mathematics

The core LSTM cell implements the following equations:

```
f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)    # Forget gate
i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)    # Input gate
g_t = tanh(W_g · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_g)  # Candidate cell state
o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)    # Output gate

c_t = f_t ⊙ c_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ g_t       # New cell state
h_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(c_t)                  # New hidden state
```

### Optimizations

- **Layer Normalization**: Applied to gate pre-activations and states
- **Gradient Flow**: Optimized through proper initialization and normalization
- **Memory Efficiency**: Combined weight matrices for faster computation

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Bidirectional Processing

The implementation supports bidirectional LSTM processing:
- Forward pass processes sequence left-to-right
- Backward pass processes sequence right-to-left
- Outputs are concatenated for richer representations

### Layer Normalization

Applied at multiple points for training stability:
- Gate pre-activations
- Cell states
- Hidden states
